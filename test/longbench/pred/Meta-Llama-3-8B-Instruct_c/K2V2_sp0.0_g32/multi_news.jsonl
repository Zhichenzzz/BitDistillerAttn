The building is one of the best-preserved from the period ever found in the UK and features beautifully worked flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch.

{"pred": " \n\nThe discovery of a new dinosaur species, Caihong juji, has shed light on the evolution of iridescent feathers in theropod dinosaurs. The species, which lived 160 million years ago in what is now northeastern China, had feathers on its head, chest, and tail that were likely iridescent, with melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those found in hummingbirds. The team found that the melanosomes in Caihong's feathers were similar to those found in hummingbirds, suggesting that the dinosaur's feathers may have had a similar iridescent effect. The discovery of Caihong's iridescent feathers is significant because it suggests that iridescence may have evolved in theropod dinosaurs before the origin of birds. The study also found that Caihong had a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it also had a crested head that more closely resembled that of a Velociraptor. The team suggests that Caihong may have used its iridescent feathers for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The discovery of Caihong's iridescent feathers is a significant find in the field of paleontology, and it is hoped that further study of the fossil will provide more insights into the evolution of iridescence in theropod dinosaurs.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, including soda, sports drinks, and kombucha, but excludes drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient. The tax was implemented to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for important projects, and subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families.\n\nHowever, the tax has been criticized for being regressive, as it disproportionately affects low-income families. Many businesses, including Costco, have seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks, with some customers opting to buy the products outside of the city. The tax has also been criticized for being inconsistent, as it does not apply to sugar-heavy beverages sold at Starbucks.\n\nIn related news, Cook County, Illinois has repealed its own sweetened beverage tax, which was implemented in August 2017. The tax was repealed after a tremendous public outcry and a decline in sales for retailers. The repeal was seen as a victory for the beverage industry, which spent millions fighting the tax.\n\nIn Washington state, a bill is being re-introduced to bring a sugary drink tax statewide. The tax would add nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold. Some are worried that the tax would be bad for local businesses, while others see it as a way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\nThe Seattle City Council has been criticized for not providing clear data on how the tax would affect local businesses.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

He appears injured but rolls from his back onto his front. Six minutes later, a soldier appears at the side of the frame and appears to shoot the man in the back of the head, per the AP.

Now this video seems to give us the proof,\" says the chairwoman of Mexico's Senate Commission on Human Rights, per the Washington Post, which identifies the man shot as Raul Jimenez Martinez, 46.

{"pred": " \n\nThe United States is on the brink of a government shutdown as Congress fails to agree on a spending bill. The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the new federal health law and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats are refusing to accept these changes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance, refusing to negotiate with House Republicans and urging President Barack Obama to veto any bill that includes changes to the health law. The shutdown could have significant economic and social impacts on the Washington D.C. region, where the federal government is the largest employer and contractor. Local economists estimate that the region could lose $200 million a day and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. The shutdown could also lead to delays in the processing of federal benefits, including Social Security and Medicare, and could have a disproportionate impact on the region's economy. Lawmakers are scrambling to find a solution, but it remains unclear what will happen if a shutdown occurs. The shutdown could have widespread ripple effects, including delays in the processing of passport applications, visa applications, and clinical trials, as well as disruptions to the federal judiciary and the processing of income tax returns. Local governments are setting aside funds to prepare for the potential shutdown, but it remains to be seen what will happen if a shutdown occurs.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The findings suggest that younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tend to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to more aggressive treatment.\n\nThe study also found that younger patients are more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy than older patients, and that they have a higher five-year survival rate. However, the researchers note that it is unclear whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths.\n\nExperts agree that doctors should be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer, particularly in younger patients who may not exhibit symptoms until the disease has advanced. Dr. Samantha Hendren, the lead author of the study, emphasizes the importance of recognizing warning signs of colon cancer, such as dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nThe study's findings have raised questions about whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age. While some experts believe that the data does not support expanding screening to younger age groups, others argue that the increasing incidence of colon cancer among people under 50 warrants further research and consideration.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer, particularly in younger patients who may be more likely to experience advanced-stage disease.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham. The criminal neglect charges are still pending, though Sarah Markham's attorney—Mark O'Mara, who defended George Zimmerman—says he expects they will be dismissed now.

On Wednesday morning, a man, later identified as 18-year-old Dallas Swonger, was caught on surveillance video urinating in the reservoir. In response, the city decided to drain 38 million gallons of water from the reservoir, citing health and safety concerns. However, many experts and officials have questioned the decision, stating that the risk of contamination is extremely low and that the water is safe to drink.\n\nSwonger has denied that he urinated in the water, claiming that he instead urinated on the wall next to the reservoir. He has also expressed frustration and disappointment over the situation, stating that he does not want people to think he is a \"dumb ass\" for urinating in the water. Swonger and his friends were given written citations for trespassing and barred from the park for 30 days.\n\nThe city's decision to drain the water has been met with criticism from many, including a former lobbyist for large industrial water customers who believes that the city is \"wasting\" money and resources. Others have questioned the decision, stating that it is a \"public relations\" move rather than a necessary health and safety measure.\n\nDespite the controversy, the city has maintained that its decision is based on public health and safety concerns, and that it is following the advice of professionals. The city's Water Bureau administrator has stated that the decision to drain the water is not a debate, but rather a necessary step to ensure the safety of Portland's water customers.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the city's open-air reservoir system, which is set to be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The city has opted to stop fighting federal mandates on open-air reservoirs and is instead working to comply with the new regulations.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding the incident has sparked a heated debate about the city's decision to drain the water and the risks associated with urinating in the reservoir.

{"pred": " \n\nRecent discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin have revealed that ancient humans were more advanced than previously thought. The oldest innovations were axes designed to be held in the palm, which were shaped like a tear drop and had a rounded end and a pointed eye. These tools were used for chopping down branches and carcasses of large animals. The next technological revolution, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The researchers found numerous smaller, flatter, and sharper stone tools, which were designed for specific purposes, such as blades, scrapers, and spear heads. The tools were made of obsidian, which was sourced from far away, and were shaped at the site itself. This suggests that there was a complex culture, where ancient humans exchanged raw materials and possibly food, and used pigments symbolically. The findings also suggest that the beginning of the Middle Stone Age in Kenya was preceded by a long and tumultuous phase in the region, with repeated cycles of droughts and high rainfall, which would have made life difficult for early humans. The researchers believe that hominin populations did not disappear, but rather adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, and sharing, and innovation. The findings have a significant impact on our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behaviors. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never was, and that complex behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species. The relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago remains to be understood. \n\nNote: The summary is a concise and clear overview of the main points from the four news passages.

", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Kieran was born deaf with small lobes where his ears should be. He has been able to hear thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid. The surgery was primarily cosmetic, but it brings huge psychological benefits, boosting his confidence and helping him to feel like his friends. Kieran's parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were \"on cloud nine\" after the procedure, saying they couldn't have wished for a better result. The surgery was performed by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who used cartilage from Kieran's ribs to create the ear frameworks. The procedure is not to improve hearing but to give Kieran a more normal appearance. About 100 children a year in the UK are born without one or both ears, a condition known as microtia. Researchers are working on a new approach to ear reconstruction using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue, which could be less invasive than the current method. The surgery is a major operation, but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. Kieran will have a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

According to new research, dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, with low, throaty whooshes of air rather than the high-pitched screams we are familiar with. The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of birds and crocodiles and found that closed-mouth vocalizations, where the beak is kept closed, are more common in larger birds and may have evolved independently at least 16 times in birds. This suggests that some dinosaurs may have made similar sounds, perhaps during mating displays. The researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups, identifying 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use this behavior. The study also found that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, which may have used it for mating displays. The researchers suggest that the sounds made by dinosaurs may have been more like the coos of doves or the hoots of owls rather than the roars we are used to.

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a computer algorithm, they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from the brain activity of individuals who watched the videos. This breakthrough has the potential to pave the way for reading minds, allowing us to see what's going on in someone's mind without visual stimulation, such as dreams and thoughts.\n\nThe study involved 12 participants who watched two sets of movie trailers while lying still inside an MRI machine. The researchers recorded the brain activity and used it to develop a computer model that matched features of the videos with patterns of brain activity. The model was then used to reconstruct the videos based on the brain activity recorded by the MRI.\n\nThe reconstructed videos are blurry and dream-like, but they are a continuous representation of the actual videos. This is a major leap towards reconstructing internal imagery and opening a window into the movies in our minds. The technology could potentially be used to broadcast imagery, allowing people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements.\n\nThe researchers also to explore the potential of this technology to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog, such as dreams. They also hope to use this technology to understand how the brain processes visual experiences and to shed light on how the brain understands and processes visual experiences.\n\nThe study's lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, said that the results shed light on how the brain works in naturalistic conditions and that the brain is not just one big blob of tissue, but rather consists of dozens, even hundreds of modules, each of which does a different thing. The researchers hope to look at more visual modules and try to build models for every single part of the visual system.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, from allowing people to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements, to potentially being able to watch people's dreams or memories.

The Syrian army statement said no military commanders or personnel were hurt in the explosions, but Iranian Press TV reported that one of its correspondents, Maya Nasser, a 33-year-old Syrian national, died in an exchange of fire in the area following the blasts.\n\nThe blasts were the latest to hit the Syrian capital as the country's civil war intensified and appeared to show the deep reach of the rebels determined to topple President Bashar Assad's regime.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

{"pred": " \n\nEgypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, which are expected to consolidate the gains made by Islamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party. The Brotherhood is expected to win a majority of the seats, potentially even a clean majority, although the exact outcome is uncertain due to the lack of clarity on the formula for allocating seats among parties. The Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength before, and it has said it intends to form a coalition or unity government to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals or Westerners who may fear an Islamist takeover.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him out of office. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, face corruption charges in the same case.\n\nThe economy has slowed due to the unrest, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44 percent and the benchmark EGX 30 stock index losing 49 percent last year. The country is also facing growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won't cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June.\n\nProtesters are preparing to take to the streets on January 25 to mark the anniversary of the mass rallies that drove Mubarak from office. The new parliament is expected to be formed on January 23, and it will likely face a difficult period of adjustment for the Egyptian state and economy. \n\nOverall, the situation in Egypt remains uncertain and volatile, with many challenges ahead for the country as it transitions to a new government and economy. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a concise and clear manner, highlighting the main points of the news passages. It provides an overview of the situation in Egypt, including the parliamentary elections, the trial of former President Mubarak, and the economic and political challenges facing the country.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
