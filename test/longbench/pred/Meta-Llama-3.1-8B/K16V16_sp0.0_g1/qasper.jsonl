Attention works by using dot product or sometimes addition followed by linear projection to a scalar which models the similarity between two vectors. Subsequently, softmax is applied which gives high probabilities to most matching word representations. This assumes that there is some highly matched word pairs already existing and high scores will be assigned to them.
