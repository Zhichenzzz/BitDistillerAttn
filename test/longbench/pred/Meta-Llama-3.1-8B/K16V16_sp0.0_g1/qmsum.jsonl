{"pred": " The working design of the remote control is to send a message to the device, like TV or VCR or DVD player, using a portable device. The portable device needs an energy source to do the functions, which can be transferred into some kind of message and then processed by the chip and generate some information to the main device. The main device will do the particular action we want. The components of the remote control are the energy source, the user interface, the chip, and the infrared LED source. The user interface can be buttons or keys or moving jacks. The chip is mainly a digital signal processing chip. The infrared LED source sends the information to the main device. The main device has a switch to do particular operations, and we need to check the specifications of different brands of devices and do their encryption codes. The components of the remote control are the main chip, the DSB chip, and the power switch. The DSB chip has some interaction with the main chip, like volume and decrease or increase. The user can use the DSB chip to send some information to the main chip. The user can also train the speech recogniser for particular users. The speech recogniser can be possible, but it is expensive. The automatic on-off control is also a bit problematic, because different criteria for different people.

But that, if you did a high-pass filtering, as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation, uh, uh, Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that, perhaps one of the reasons for that working was maybe not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a positive power spectrum you get some negative values, and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum. So, what Hirsch did was, uh, set them to zero. So if you imagine a waveform that's all positive, which is the time trajectory of energy, um, and, uh, shifting it downwards, and then getting rid of the negative parts, that's essentially throwing away the low-energy things.

{"pred": " PhD B approached the back-end of the Aurora recognizer by trying to improve the performance of the back-end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things. He had this matrix where he would take the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then optimize the HTK system and run that again. So look at the difference there and then do the same thing for the ICSI-OGI front-end. He started looking and now he's looking at the point where he wants to know what should he change in the HTK back-end in order to try to improve it. So. One of the first things he thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models. So he went online and he found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits and just looked at, you know, the number of phones in each one of the digits. Um you know, sort of the canonical way of setting up an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone and um so then the total number of states for a word would just be, you know, the number of phones times three. And so when he did that for the Italian digits, he got a number of states, ranging on the low end from nine to the high end, eighteen. Um. Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there's an initial null and a final null so when they use uh models that have eighteen states, there're really sixteen states. They've got those initial and final null states. And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits, the four and five which um, according to my, you know, sort of off the cuff calculation, should have eighteen states each. So they had sixteen. So that's pretty close. Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter. So the majority of them wanna have nine states. And so theirs are s sort of twice as long. So my guess about what's happening is that you know, if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have, you know, half as much training data for those models. Because if you have a long word and you're training it to eighteen states, um you've got, you know, you've got the same number of Gaussians, you've gotta train in each", "answers": ["PhD B focused on Italian and experimented with the number of states for different words.
