He also mentioned that the use of a Wiener filter could be helpful in reducing the noise in the speech.\n\nQuery: What was the problem with the VTS system?\nAnswer: The problem with the VTS system was that it was not robust to changes in the level of the speech signal, and that it was sensitive to the level of the speech signal. This was because the VTS system was based on the assumption that the speech signal was always at the same level, but in reality the speech signal could be at different levels. This made it difficult for the VTS system to accurately identify the speech signal.\n\nQuery: What was the suggestion made by the professor?\nAnswer: The professor suggested that it might be helpful to apply on-line normalization before applying VTS, and also to consider using a Wiener filter to reduce the noise in the speech.\n\nQuery: What was the result of the experiment?\nAnswer: The result of the experiment was that the VTS system did not work well, and that it was not robust to changes in the level of the speech signal.
