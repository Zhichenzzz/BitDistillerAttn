The study also found that cigarette smoke exposure caused MRSA to become more aggressive and invasive, making it more likely to cause severe pneumonia. The study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke is not just a risk factor for smokers, but also for those who are exposed to secondhand smoke.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego.

The skeleton, believed to be that of a child, was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. The discovery is part of a three-year project to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. The project, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Wiltshire Museum, has also uncovered flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets and a Roman brooch at Marden henge. The site, built in 2,400 BC, is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country. The excavation of the site has also revealed pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit, suggesting that the house was never a permanent residence but connected with great gatherings for feasts. The site will be open to the public for an open day, which will feature finds on display, tours and activities.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The tax, which adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink, was implemented to discourage people from consuming these drinks, which are linked to health problems. However, the tax has been met with widespread criticism and has led to a significant decline in sales of these drinks. Many people are choosing to buy their drinks outside of the city, and some retailers are even posting signs to direct customers to locations outside of the city where they can buy their drinks without the tax. The article also discusses the potential impact of the tax on local businesses, including a local bar and grill that relies heavily on soda sales. The article concludes by noting that the tax is not a solution to the problem of sugar consumption, but rather a regressive tax that disproportionately affects low-income families. It also notes that the tax has been met with resistance from many people, including some who have chosen to buy their drinks outside of the city. Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding the sugary drink tax and the potential negative consequences it may have on local businesses and communities.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pregnant women use acetaminophen only when necessary and for a short period of time.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The study's findings suggest that it is important to maintain a healthy weight and avoid yo-yo dieting, which is defined as repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain. The study's authors suggest that the findings may be used as motivation to keep weight off and reduce the risk of heart disease. \n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked yo-yo dieting to an increased risk of heart disease. The researchers suggest that the findings may be due to the fact that yo-yo dieting can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, which can damage the heart and increase the risk of heart disease. \n\nThe study's findings have important implications for people with coronary artery disease, as they suggest that maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding yo-yo dieting may be an important part of managing the condition. The researchers suggest that the findings may also be used to develop new treatments for coronary artery disease. \n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding yo-yo dieting may be an important part of preventing and treating coronary artery disease. The researchers suggest that the findings may also be used to develop new treatments for the condition. \n\nReferences: \n1. \"Weight cycling and cardiovascular disease\" (2019).

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

{"pred": " \n\nA recent study has found that colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start. The study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011. The researchers found that one in seven colon cancer patients is under 50, and these patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. The study suggests that the medical community should be more vigilant in screening for colon cancer in younger adults, and that guidelines may need to be revised to reflect this trend. The researchers also found that younger patients are more likely to have surgery and radiation therapy than older patients, and that they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The study's findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, but the researchers note that more research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made. The study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, said that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments. The findings of the study are significant, as they suggest that colon cancer is not just a disease of the elderly, but can affect people of all ages.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The tools, made from obsidian and other materials, are considered to be part of the Middle Stone Age, a period characterized by the development of more sophisticated tools and technologies. The discovery suggests that early humans were able to adapt to changing environmental conditions, including climate change, and that they were able to develop complex social networks and exchange goods and ideas over long distances. The findings also suggest that the development of modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, occurred much earlier than previously thought, and that it was not a single event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years. The discovery has implications for our understanding of human evolution and the origins of modern human behavior, and highlights the importance of studying the African archaeological record in order to better understand the development of human societies.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The ocean, which was about 1 mile deep in places, was a significant portion of the planet's surface and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. The discovery is based on measurements of atmospheric water and its deuterated form across the Martian globe, which showed strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment indicative of great water loss. The scientists also found that the ocean was likely to have been a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars, rather than just the northern hemisphere, and that it was a warm and wet world in its youth, with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes. The discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as it suggests that the planet was once habitable and that life could have emerged there. The scientists also found that the planet's atmosphere thinned over time, causing the ocean to evaporate and eventually freeze, leaving behind only 13% of the ocean today. The discovery is based on measurements of sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states.

{"pred": " The article discusses the evolution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds, which is a unique way of making sounds that involves the skin in the neck area and the esophageal pouch. The study found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers analyzed the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptilian groups and found that only animals with a relatively large body size (about the size of a dove or larger) use this behavior. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and that it may have been used during mating displays. The researchers also found that the evolution of closed-mouth vocalization is associated with large body sizes, which is a matter of physics. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and the possibility that some dinosaurs may have made similar sounds to those of birds today. The study's authors are now working on integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors produced.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The hikers, who claim they were hiking in northern Iraq and were not aware they had crossed into Iran, have been at the center of a dispute between the United States and Tehran. Iran's judiciary spokesman said the trial could not go ahead as scheduled because of the absence of Sarah Shourd, who was released on $500,000 bail in September this year and returned to the United States.

The first supermoon appeared on December 3, and the second one will be visible on New Year's Day 2018. The third and final supermoon will be on January 31, which will also feature a total lunar eclipse. The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, and will be the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years.

If you can't go outside, you can watch the livestream or take a picture of the supermoon with your smartphone or DSLR camera.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

The DNC learned of the attempt on Tuesday, CNN reports. The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia.

The blasts, which were likely caused by a car bomb and an explosive device, targeted the heavily guarded compound, setting off hours of sporadic gunfire and a raging fire. The Syrian army said no military commanders or personnel were hurt in the explosions, but the attack was widely condemned by the international community. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that heavy clashes were taking place inside the compound, with casualties on both sides. The attack was the latest in a series of bombings and attacks on security sites and symbols of regime power in Syria, which has been embroiled in a civil war for over 18 months. The conflict has killed nearly 30,000 people, and the international community has been unable to agree on a unified response to the crisis. The U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for international action to stop the war in Syria, but the Security Council has been unable to agree on a resolution.
