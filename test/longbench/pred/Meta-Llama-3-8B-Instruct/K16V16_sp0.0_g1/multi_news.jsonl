Furthermore, the researchers discovered that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.

The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children.\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The condition can be severe, with some patients requiring ventilator support and others experiencing long-term disability.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidance on the prevention and management of AFM, including the importance of good hygiene, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and protecting against mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nA cluster of AFM cases was reported in Colorado in 2014, which coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).

The company held a special event at the University of Southern California's Galen Center, where it showcased the new technology and several games that will be available with it. Kinect is a motion-control system that allows users to play games and interact with the Xbox 360 console using gestures and spoken commands, without the need for a controller. The system can recognize a wider range of motion and even differentiate voices.\n\nDuring the event, Microsoft demonstrated several games that will be available with Kinect, including whitewater rafting, racing, virtual Tai Chi, and a Star Wars game that lets players fight Darth Vader with a light saber. There were also sports games that let players jump hurdles, run sprints, play volleyball, kick a soccer ball, and bowl. Another game lets players train and play with a virtual tiger cub.\n\nThe company also showed off a collection of dashboard apps that use motion controls to interact with Netflix, allowing users to scroll through photos, start live video chats with friends, and share photos.\n\nMicrosoft has not yet announced pricing or availability for Kinect, but it is expected to be released this fall. The company will provide more details about the technology and games at its press conference on Monday.\n\nOverall, Kinect is seen as Microsoft's answer to Nintendo's Wii, which popularized game play without the need for a controller. However, Kinect takes it a step further by allowing users to use their body as a controller, and recognizing a wider range of motion and voices. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people play games and interact with their consoles.", "answers": ["Microsoft unveiled its much-hyped Project Natal motion control system—now renamed “Kinect”—at E3 last night, in a performance long on grandiosity and short on actual revelations.

The PCT Association has reported a 300% increase in website traffic and a surge in permit requests for long-distance hikes. The trail, which stretches 2,650 miles from California to Washington, has traditionally been a popular destination for hikers, but the recent surge in interest has raised concerns about overcrowding and the impact on the environment.\n\nSome hikers have expressed concerns about the trail's ability to handle the increased traffic, citing issues such as litter, human waste, and damage to the trail itself. The PCT Association has implemented a permit system to help manage the number of hikers on the trail, but some hikers have expressed frustration with the system, which they feel is too restrictive.\n\nDespite the challenges, many hikers are still drawn to the PCT, which offers a unique and challenging hiking experience. The trail's remote wilderness areas and stunning natural beauty make it an attractive destination for those seeking adventure and solitude.\n\nIn addition to the PCT, other hiking trails are also experiencing increased popularity, including the Appalachian Trail, which is the subject of a new movie starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. The movie, \"A Walk in the Woods,\" is based on Bill Bryson's book about his attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail with his friend.\n\nOverall, the surge in interest in hiking trails is a positive development, as it highlights the importance of outdoor recreation and the need to protect and preserve our natural resources. However, it also raises important questions about how to manage the impact of increased traffic on these trails and ensure that they remain accessible and enjoyable for all hikers.", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside.

To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

{"pred": " \n\nA recent study published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics has raised concerns about the use of acetaminophen, a common pain reliever found in over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol, during pregnancy. The study found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. The researchers analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers, who were part of the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002. The study found that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy was associated with higher risks of ADHD-like behaviors in children.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, the study does not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD. The researchers also found that women who reported taking acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more had a 50% increased risk of their children receiving ADHD medication.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among health experts, who are urging pregnant women to be cautious when using acetaminophen. Dr. Beate Ritz, the study's author, advises pregnant women to try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more is known about the risks. Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, suggests that pregnant women consider nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.\n\nThe study's findings are not without controversy, with some experts arguing that the study does not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.

Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The Warratyi rock-shelter, located about 550 km north of Adelaide, contains ancient artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and the earliest known use of ochre in Australia. The site pushes back the earliest known dates on the development of key technologies, such as bone and stone axe technologies, and the use of ochre. The discovery also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and the giant bird Genyornis.\n\nThe find challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The team's leader, Giles Hamm, believes that the development of these fine stone tools and bone technology happened as a local innovation, due to a local cultural evolution.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human migration and settlement in Australia. It suggests that once humans first set foot on the Australian coastline, it took a mere 1,000 years for them to expand out into the arid interior. This is further evidence of the ingenuity of what now stands as the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.\n\nThe find is also significant because it provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, which has been a topic of debate among archaeologists. The discovery of bones and eggs of these extinct species in the rock-shelter suggests that early humans were living in close enough quarters to find and bring back these remains.\n\nThe study has been published in Nature and has sparked debate among archaeologists. While some have questioned the accuracy of the dating methods used, others have praised the methodology and significance of the find.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated.

{"pred": " \n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of galactic expansion proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. According to Hooper, harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's available resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization alone in the vastness of space. The paper suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy before those stars become inaccessible forever.\n\nThe concept of capturing stars is not new and has been explored in science fiction. Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described spherical, energy-trapping alien structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" and physicist Freeman Dyson proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960. Dyson realized that alien civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation.\n\nThe idea of capturing stars is not just limited to science fiction. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed that very old and advanced civilizations would be of three types: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Humans might reach Type II in a few thousand years and Type III in a few hundred thousand to a million years.\n\nThe concept of capturing stars is not just theoretical. Scientists have proposed that a swarm of satellites, known as a Dyson sphere, could be used to harness the energy of a star. The satellite would not be in orbit, it would actually hover in space, and would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites. The satellite would be stabilized by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun and would be able to collect energy from the star and beam it back to the home planet.\n\nThe idea of capturing stars is not just limited to science fiction and theoretical concepts. WARCZone, a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, has been created to store and make available a collection of websites that have been archived by the Internet Archive. The collection includes websites that have been uploaded by individuals and organizations, and provides a unique insight into the history of the internet.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of capturing stars is not just a theoretical concept, but a real possibility that could be achieved in the future.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

The new law also paves the way for the establishment of a licensing agency to regulate a lawful medical cannabis industry on the island. The legislation makes possession of up to 2oz (56.6g) of marijuana a petty offence that would not result in a criminal record, and cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted. Additionally, Rastafarians can now legally use marijuana for religious purposes, and tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad will be able to apply for permits to legally buy small amounts of \"ganja\" in Jamaica.\n\nThe move is seen as a major step forward for Jamaica, which has long been a major supplier of marijuana to the US and regional islands. The country's national security minister, Peter Bunting, emphasized that the legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. Instead, the goal is to create a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp, which could bring in new revenue streams for the country.\n\nThe decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica is part of a broader trend of easing restrictions on the drug globally. In the US, more than 20 states allow some form of medical marijuana, and three states have legalized recreational use. In the Americas, Uruguay has become the first nation to create a legal marijuana market, and Argentina has decriminalized personal possession of marijuana.\n\nThe new law in Jamaica is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy, particularly in the areas of health tourism and the development of innovative pot-derived items.

{"pred": " \n\nNASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the ancient history of Mars. According to their research, a massive ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. The ocean, which was a mile deep in some areas, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding radically rewrites what scientists believed about Mars' ancient history, which was previously thought to be a dry and barren planet.\n\nThe research team used infrared telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere and found that the water on Mars contains a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, than on Earth. This suggests that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the planet. The longer water persists on a planetary body in one location, the more likely it is that it would provide a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. The finding also suggests that Mars was once warm and wet, with long-standing bodies of water, lakes, and deltas, making it a more likely candidate for supporting life.\n\nThe research team's findings are supported by other studies, including one that used the same infrared telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's atmosphere was once much thicker and more hospitable to life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, new research suggests that dinosaurs may not have sounded like the iconic roar we're familiar with. Instead, they may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as coos, hoots, and murmurs. The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of birds and found that many species use a type of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization, where air is pushed into an esophageal pouch to produce sound. This type of vocalization is often used for mating displays and territorial defense.\n\nThe researchers found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. They also found that only animals with a relatively large body size use this type of vocalization, which suggests that dinosaurs may have used it as well. The study's authors suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as coos, hoots, and murmurs, and that they may have used closed-mouth vocalization for mating displays and territorial defense.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of the sounds that dinosaurs made. While we may never know exactly what they sounded like, the study suggests that they may have been more like birds than we previously thought. The researchers hope to continue their study by integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors produced.\n\nIn related news, sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the film Jurassic Park, revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the dinosaurs' vocalizations, including tortoises, geese, and even his own dog. Rydstrom's work on the film helped to create the iconic sounds of the T. rex and Velociraptors, and his techniques have been used in many other films and TV shows.\n\nOverall, the study and Rydstrom's work highlight the importance of understanding the sounds that animals make, and how they use those sounds to communicate.

{"pred": " \n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has sparked a massive search operation, with various theories and probabilities being considered. Bayesian statisticians, who use mathematical techniques inspired by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, have been involved in the search for the plane. In 2011, Bayesian statisticians helped locate an Air France plane that had been missing for two years. The team from Metron Inc, led by senior analyst Colleen Keller, used Bayesian statistics to analyze the data and provide a probability map of where the plane might be found. The map showed a much tighter area to search, which led to the discovery of the plane's wreckage. The team's approach allowed them to consider all the data, including uncertainties, and combine contradictory views. The Bayesian approach is flexible and can be updated with new information. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is ongoing, with the possibility that the plane may never be found. Bayesian statisticians are being used to analyze the data and provide probabilities of where the plane might be found. The search is challenging due to the vast area of the Indian Ocean where the plane may have crashed. The team's approach has been successful in the past, but it is unclear if it will be successful in this case.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found. Bayesian techniques have helped people find World War II U-boats, men overboard, and sunken treasure, but there's no evidence that Malaysia is employing them now. \"I suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before Moneyball,\" says a biostatistician."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3727}

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, which took place while the vehicle was on autopilot. According to Tesla, the driver had received several visual and audible warnings to take control of the wheel, but did not do so for six seconds before the collision. The company also stated that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier, was not repaired after a previous accident and was crushed, which contributed to the severity of the crash.\n\nHuang's family has come forward, stating that he had complained to the dealership about the vehicle's autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions. The family has also provided an invoice to investigators showing that Huang took the car in for repairs due to this issue.\n\nTesla has released a statement defending its autopilot system, stating that it has improved system reliability and reduces crash rates by as much as 40%. The company also pointed out that there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers, but only one fatality every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has released a statement saying that replacement work was scheduled for the damaged barrier, but was delayed due to weather conditions. The previous accident that damaged the barrier took place 11 days before Huang's fatal crash.\n\nThe fatal crash has raised concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles, with some calling for increased regulation and scrutiny of the technology.
